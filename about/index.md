I'm Elena, Russian tutor & English translator, and I've been living in the United Kingdom since 2007, when I moved to sunny Essex :) from Russia.

My interests are (but not limited to :): linguistics, British culture, world history.

Currently I enjoy learning Italian and French as a hobby.

#### Personal Mission

Creative communication to promote tolerance between individuals and nations, that is essential to a peaceful future of the planet.
