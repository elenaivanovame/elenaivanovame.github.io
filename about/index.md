I'm Elena, Russian tutor & English translator. I've been living in United Kingdom since 2007, in sunny Essex :).

My interests are (but not limited to :) :

* Linguistics
* British culture
* World history

Currently I'm enjoying learning Italian and French as a hobby.

### Personal Mission

Creative communication to promote tolerance between individuals and nations, that is essential to a peaceful future on the planet.
